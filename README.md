# HTML Fun

A collection of creative, experimental, and interactive HTML projects and visual demos. Each file is a standalone HTML page showcasing a unique animation, visualization, or generative art concept.

Some files do not work as expected, and some are just experiments.

## Usage

Open any HTML file in your browser to view and interact with the demo. No build step or external dependencies required.

## License

This project is intended for learning, experimentation, and inspiration. Use freely, but please credit the original author if you share or adapt any of these demos.
